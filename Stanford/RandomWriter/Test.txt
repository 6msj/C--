Understanding Bush’s Rhetoric
In the 1990s, the current president of the United States was George H. W. Bush. From 1990 to 1991, The United States was dealing with forces in Iraq due to conflict in Kuwait. Preceding this, George Bush addressed the nation with a speech, firstly to let them know of current plans to attack Iraq and start a war, and more importantly to persuade them to react favorably to this news. The latter being more important than the former is due to a “defeat” in the Vietnam War, which lowered American morale significantly. Bush knew his audience, busy Americans who couldn’t care less to examine his speech closely, and succeeded in capturing their attention. President George H. W. Bush, through careful understanding of his audience, arranges his speech in a way to provoke emotional response that he supports with strong rapid-fire claims with questionable evidence. He then abuses the power of assumptions and great misdirection when using logical fallacies.
President George Bush was effective in structuring his speech in a way that caused the reader/listener to feel an emotional response. He did this through a few ingenious steps. The first thing to note is his careful arrangement of his topics. He brings each and every topic out, in a way to capture and incite emotional responses. The first topic choice he brings out is about Kuwait, designed to incite feelings of heroism in his fellow Americans. “Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait” (38). This accomplishes the first part of his speech arrangement, creating a strong emotional response in his audience. 
After this he relentlessly pounds into their heads to concept of war and he created a few caricatures that would represent his ideas. These caricatures would further solidify the goal of his speech to push his agenda for war. One of the caricatures is “Marine Lieutenant General Walter Boomer”; he represents one of the reasons why Bush is going to war. “A world in which brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go unchecked isn’t the kind of world we’re going to want to live in” (38). Not only is Bush creating another person to preach his ideas, he’s also using that very person to relate to the audience. The word “we’re” is used isn’t of a regular “I”. The quote is very generic and easy to relate to and in a way, agreeing with the quote and relating to it, isn’t a far stretch down the road from agreeing and supporting the war. Another caricature that Bush uses to speak his ideas is “Master Sergeant J. P. Kendall”, someone who mentions the price of gas. Gas was a very important component of the reasons for going to war, but here, Bush trivializes the issue and pushes for more “heroic” issues instead. 
The next building block of Bush’s speech was his push for urgency. In the very first paragraph in the “President’s Address to Nation”, Bush speaks instantly of urgency: “Just two hours ago, allied air forces began attacks on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait” (38). His first line hooks the audience’s attention.  The audience might not know the background information in Kuwait or Iraq but they know what is implied by “military targets” and “attacks”. This urgency Bush creates was very effective in not only capturing the attention of the audience; it was also very effective in causing them, during the course of his speech, to create that snap, “flight or fight” emotional response. Urgency alone does not build “flight or fight” adequately, so Bush creates a feeling that they, the audience, have to decide, now. He does this subtly throughout: “Saddam clearly felt that by stalling and threatening and defying the United Nations he could weaken the forces arrayed against him” (39). The word “stalling” here is strong in creating an image. Think about manual transmission cars, probably more common in the 1990s than they are now. When a manual transmission car stalls, the driver immediately feels the need to start the car up again, in hope someone does not honk their horn at him. 
Bush continues to hammer down on the urgency of the situation and creates an ideal image that he is a savior, trying to help the people: “The 28 countries with forces in the Gulf area have exhausted all reasonable efforts to reach a peaceful conclusion, have no choice but to drive Saddam from Kuwait by force. We will not fail” (38). These two sentences show that Bush is doing this from a perspective of vulnerability. He’s tried and failed many times and now as a “last ditch effort”, will have to resort to violence and war. This is extremely effective considering that Bush also mentioned in the second paragraph of his speech that the conflict has only been going on for five months, an extremely short amount of time diplomatically. His “exhaustive effort” was only five months? This is an example of him knowing his audience very well. His audience will not go back to his words and scrutinize every detail, and even if they did, they are not well-read/educated enough to correctly analyze the minute details of his speech. The next thing he accomplishes is that he further solidifies the concept of going to war. He mentioned the word “force” which builds on his idea of war. As the reader or listener reads on, they continue to become more and more comfortable with the idea of Bush’s war. The last thing he accomplishes was a backdrop and reference to the Vietnam War. He understands that the previous war did not go well and he mentions that this time, they won’t fail. This is strong phrasing because he increases his audience’s confidence in him, which increases the likelihood that they will support what he is saying. 
Again, Bush’s push for urgency is phenomenal: “The world could wait no longer. Sanctions were tried for well over five months and we and our allies concluded that sanctions alone would not force Saddam from Kuwait” (38). He managed to create the image and idea five months is a really long time. Average people do not have a good frame of reference on political conflicts and will be spoon-fed anything. To put this example into better light, imagine a person “Tobias” can run swim a mile in twelve minutes; it’s impossible to tell if that is a fast or slow time unless one is versed in swimming culture. Likewise, someone without a strong political background will have a good frame of reference on the “five months” Bush mentions and may actually feel that it’s a long time. Bush’s abuse of this knowledge continually makes his speech all the more persuasive. 
He also made great use of repetition in the structure of his speech. Bush repeated the words, “While the World waited” (38-39) four times. He’s using repetition to make a claim, and these claims are so fast and rapid that he doesn’t need to nor want to clarify them. If he stops to clarify and explain or give evidence of these claims, it ruins the flow of his speech and ruins his credibility because his claims might be evaluated as true or false. Having even one claim equate to false is a huge blow to credibility and Bush smartly avoids this trap. 
Claims are propositions, claims of fact being that “something” is or is not, claims of value being the good and evil of that “something”; claims of policy is that “something” should be “something” else. Bush made some strong claims, strong claims that were very effective in “proving” his point. 
What were some of Bush’s major claims? Bush claims that “The world could wait no longer” (38). This is a claim of fact. Upon closer inspection, it is obviously not true but its truth value isn’t relevant compared to what it accomplished. What was Bush trying to accomplish with this statement? He, as before, pounds into the heads of those listening or reading the urgency, the “flight or fight” response. This “urgency” he creates isn’t obvious, but very subtle. Evaluating this claim to be true or false is not as important as evaluating the goals of this claim and what its effects are. In that respect, this claim of fact, although false, is a “Winner” in Bush’s eyes and is also a success when it comes to persuasion. 
He also uses the claim of value, with its primary purpose to incite a response to the helplessness of Kuwait, the helplessness of the audience’s neighbor. “A member of the Arab league and member of the United Nations—was crushed, its people brutalized.” (38) He paints an image to Americans of their neighbors being brutalized and taken advantage of. This image naturally centers to them and now the imagery is, instead of the neighbor, themselves.  This claim of value isn’t strong by itself but he uses it to drive his claim of policy.   
The claim of policy Bush makes is that he has to “drive Saddam from Kuwait by force” (38). The claim of policy is also the final point he wants his audience to agree with. If they agree with his claim of value, it naturally follows, that they’d listen and find his claim of policy agreeable. Because of this, his claim of policy, backed by an underlying claim of value (every American’s need to protect their neighbors, and in some respect themselves), makes for a very strong argument.  
How could Bush get away with a lot of these claims and fallacies? Would a normal person get away with the same claims? There are underlying assumptions in play that make Bush’s speech work for him and succeed in persuading Americans to follow Bush. Assumptions are preconceived notions that may or may not be true. The most important assumption in Bush’s speech is the assumption of authority. Do students actively question their teachers or professors? The answer is no, so why question, theoretically the most powerful person in the United States? If he is not the most authoritative person, why is he President? Using the assumption of authority, he could create many rapid-fire claims and not have to support his claims. “We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein’s nuclear bomb potential” (38).  It’s clear everyone has potential to have nuclear bomb but Bush knows this statement would be questioned because he had the power of authority. With this in mind, his statement of nuclear bomb potential holds more weight and makes for a strong example for why America would need to go to war. 
Another assumption Bush brings to the table is the cause-and-effect assumption; Bush mentions “cause and effect” many times during his speech. He brings up time and time again that he “has” to do something about Saddam Hussein. “The United States, together with the United Nations, exhausted every means at our disposal to bring this crisis to a peaceful end” (39).  The cause and effect assumption allows him to create many scenarios and attribute it all to Saddam Hussein. This type of assumption is also effective when he erects a solution. Going to war and having peace restored is an assumption Bush brings to the table. 
The last assumption that is of relevance when discussing how persuasive Bush’s speech is is the sign assumption.  That is, “Saddam Hussein’s nuclear bomb potential.” (38) This assumption is powerful because the Cold War (a war riddled with nuclear bomb potential) wasn’t far in the past and America had its own history with bombings (ex. Japan). It pushes Americans further into the mindset of defending themselves and it works beautifully in that regard. 
Along with assumptions, logical fallacies follow. Logical fallacies are as their words imply; they are logical reasoning that isn’t perfect and have holes in them. Amusingly, these fallacies are not only hard to catch while analyzing the text; they’d probably make a lot of sense while hearing it. It’s only when one scrutinizes Bush’s speech, line by line, paragraph by paragraph that these fallacies will crop up. With that in mind, it’s important to note, part of President George Bush’s persuasiveness is due to the clever usage and hiding of the flaw in these fallacies. 
Using the same quote from earlier, the same quote that was praised for its effectiveness of persuasion; this quote will be looked at under the lens of illogical reasoning. “The world could wait no longer. Sanctions, though having some effect, showed no signs of accomplishing their objective. Sanctions were tried for well over five months and we and our allies concluded that sanctions alone would not force Saddam from Kuwait.” (Bush 38) This is an example of the either-or fallacy, or the false dilemma fallacy. The either-or fallacy is a logical fallacy where there are only two solutions or alternatives to a certain problem when, usually, there are more than two solutions. It is obvious that going to war isn’t the only answer. Bush knows this, and those under same goals as him know this. They know invading Iraq is not the only solution to their problem, considering only five months has passed. They know this and they still do it. Why? They do it because they can and it serves their other goals like the subject of oil, which will be further discussed later. While this behavior is deplorable in the ethical sense, it is admirable while looking at rhetoric and persuasiveness. 
Another persuasive piece of text that Bush used in his speech that was also logically fallacious was his constant remarks about Saddam Hussein. Bush painted Saddam Hussein as maniacal, crazy, and ruthless dictator that was born just to be stopped by Bush himself. Several pieces of texts from Bush’s speech support this. “… Saddam Hussein systematically raped, pillaged and plundered a tiny nation—no threat to his own. He subjected the people of Kuwait to unspeakable atrocities and among those maimed and murdered — innocent children.” (Bush 38) This is effective in persuasiveness because it creates a target for the people listening to his speech to shoot their emotional response at. Throughout his speech, Bush was slowly building up an emotional response from the audience and also quickly put up a target for the audience to direct their anger towards. From reading about Bush’s speech, it is clear what his goals were. He wanted his audience, Americans, to support his war and he achieved his goal partly because he correctly put up a scarecrow for his fellow Americans. Of course, it is still fallacious; the text is phrased in a way to discredit the opposing side. There is no evidence to back up Bush’s assertion.  
In conclusion, Bush could carefully tailor his speech because he knows his audience. He knows that his audience wouldn’t care to or wouldn’t be able to scrutinize his speech for what it really was and abused this fact. His precise arrangement did well inciting emotional responses from his audience and paints a powerful image of America being the hero. Bush also abuses assumptions that allowed his claims to go unchecked and misdirected some logical fallacies away from him. These few points together, makes his speech extremely persuasive.
